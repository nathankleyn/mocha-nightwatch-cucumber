# mocha-nightwatch-cucumber

`mocha-nightwatch-cucumber` is a [nightwatch](https://github.com/nightwatchjs/nightwatch)
compatible UI module for
[mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha) that allows you to describe your
features using Given/When/Then!

## Installing

You should first have `mocha` installed:
```
npm install -g mocha
```

Then install `mocha-nightwatch-cucumber`, either globally or inside your project:

```
npm install -g mocha-nightwatch-cucumber
```


## Usage

Write your feature(s):

```
{expect} = require 'chai'

Feature 'Math', ->
  Scenario 'Incrementing numbers', ->
    Given 'A number that starts at 0', ->
      @n = 0

    When 'the number is incremented', ->
      @n++

    Then 'it becomes 1', ->
      expect(@n).to.equal 1
```

Or if you prefer plan ole js:
```
var expect = require('chai').expect;

Feature('Math', function() {
  Scenario('Incrementing numbers', function() {
    Given('A number that starts at 0', function() {
      this.n = 0;
    });
    When('the number is incremented', function() {
      this.n++;
    });
    Then('it becomes 1', function() {
      expect(this.n).to.equal(1);
    });
  });
});
```

Then run mocha:
```
mocha --ui mocha-nightwatch-cucumber test/*
```

And you get:

### What's going on?

mocha-cucumber aliases `Scenario` and `Feature` as alieses to mocha's
exising `describe`, and `Given`/`When`/`Then`/`And`/`But` as aliases to mocha's
`it` BDD methods.   

`describe` and `it` still work as usual, so you can combine your cucumber features
with BDD specs and it will Just Work(tm).
